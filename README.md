# QA Case Study - 8fit

* Take a few minutes to explore the Profile Tab of the 8fit App.9

* Write a detailed Test Suite (~5-10 test cases) for any section of this tab.

* Document 2 bugs (functional / usability) you found while executing your test suite.

* Briefly explain (100 words or less): After this bug is fixed, how would you ensure that the same issue is not introduced again in the future?

* One of the Customer Support Agents tell you that some users are seeing the following issue: Since they completed a workout, the “Your Activity” calendar in Profile is covered by a spinning loading animation that never disappears, and the calendar never loads. Briefly document how you would troubleshoot/investigate this issue, and how you would identify the root cause.
