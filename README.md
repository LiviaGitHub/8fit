# QA Case Study - 8fit

* Task 2: Take a few minutes to explore the Profile Tab of the 8fit App.

* Task 2: Write a detailed Test Suite (~5-10 test cases) for any section of this tab.

* Task 3: Document 2 bugs (functional/usability) you found while executing your test suite.

* Task 4: Briefly explain (100 words or less): After this bug is fixed, how would you ensure that the same issue is not introduced again in the future?

* Task 5: One of the Customer Support Agents tell you that some users are seeing the following issue: Since they completed a workout, the “Your Activity” calendar in Profile is covered by a spinning loading animation that never disappears, and the calendar never loads. Briefly document how you would troubleshoot/investigate this issue, and how you would identify the root cause.

# Information:

* In the `qa_case_study` folder you can find four files:
 `master_testrail` - PDF format
 `check_the_workout_record_result` - PDF format
 `change_exercise_time_result` - PDF format
 `task4_task5.md`

 The file `master_testrail` contains 10 test cases.
 The files `check_the_workout_record_result` and `change_exercise_time_result` are 2 bug reports.
 The file `task4_task5.md` contains the tasks 4 and 5.

* All files in PDF format can be downloaded from GitHub.

* The test cases and the bug report were created in the TestRail tool. The job description asks TestRail knowledge, for this reason I chose this tool.

* `Four` of the test cases can be found in the BDD format in the `profile_feature` folder.
